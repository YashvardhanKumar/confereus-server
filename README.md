## About the App
- Millions of public conferences have been increasing yearly since the COVID-19 pandemic.
- Most existing conference management solutions are either too costly, too complicated, or too restricted in functionality.
- Some solutions require a hefty subscription or pre-conference fee; some have a difficult learning curve or a fixed interface, and some only support certain conferences or features.
- There is a lack of integration and coordination between different platforms and tools used for conference management.
- Organizers may use different tools, like,
  - Form Submission for collecting abstracts and reviewing papers,
  - mailing them by letting the user know the approval of the paper and,
  - for scheduling sessions, etc.
- This can lead to inefficiency, inconsistency, and confusion among organizers, presenters, and attendees.
- Many conferences still rely on paper-based abstracts, which consume a lot of resources and generate a lot of waste. Moreover, many conferences do not provide information about their venue's environmental or travel options.

## Underlying Technologies Available
- [Whova](https://whova.com/) is a conference management app that enhances attendees' experience and engagement. It provides agenda, networking, live polling, Q\&A, gamification, and sponsorship features. However, Whova does not have the feature for submission of abstracts for the presenter and review process, which is a crucial aspect of conference management to appoint a presenter in an event. The User Interface is very complex and hard to understand.
- [Microsoft CMT](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/) is a conference management system that handles the most complex workflows of academic conferences. However, Microsoft CMT does not provide information about the conference venue and the whereabouts of the place.
